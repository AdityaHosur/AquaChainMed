Blockchain-Watermarking Scheme Based K-Means for Medical Image:
            The main objective of this project is to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and secure sharing of medical images by combining digital watermarking, blockchain, and IPFS technologies. The system embeds a compressed watermark into a medical image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique and stores the original watermark securely on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). The resulting IPFS hash is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain through a smart contract, creating an immutable and tamper-proof record. During verification, the watermark is extracted from the image and compared to the original (retrieved via blockchain and IPFS), enabling detection of any unauthorized modification. This approach eliminates third-party dependency and enhances the trustworthiness of medical data exchange by leveraging K-Means clustering, smart contracts, and decentralized storage.
